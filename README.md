# splash2d
This is a competitive multiplayer party game

Goals:

Create a 2d game where players launch balls in a parabolic fashion and pop them to create a splash on the screen
of their team color. After a set period of time the player who covered the most area wins. 

With this project I would like to incorporate an MVC approach. We will have a server working on the model. The client
can be anything and communicates with the server to convey player control information and receive ui update information.

This project is also cross platform so Im using QT. Another aspect and dimension of this project could be AI development.
In the MVC case the AI should reside on the server only where the model is updated.
